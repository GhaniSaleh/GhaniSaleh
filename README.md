- 👋 Hi, I’m @GhaniSaleh
- 👀 I’m deeply passionate about thefields of Natural Machine Translation (NMT) and Natural Language Modeling (NLM), with a keen interest in language preservation and digitization.
- 🌱 I’m currently leading a transformative project to digitize the Tigre (Tigrayit) language, aiming to make this rich linguistic heritage accessible to future generations and promote its use in digital spaces.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that focus on natural language processing, machine learning, and linguistic research, especially those centered on underrepresented languages.
- 📫 You can reach me via [email/LinkedIn or preferred contact method] for discussions on potential collaborations, insights, and shared interests.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Despite my intetests in Tigre language, I’m also an avid fan of the ancient Geez language and its scripts, seeing it as the building blocks of the modern linguistic advancement of our language.
